In essence, they are figures composed by several choropleths in which the layout of each of them provides information about the subset of the original dataset represented. The idea is that a dataset can be subset based on one or two conditional variables, usually categorical, and only the observations that meet each characteristic are displayed in a given submap.

As an example, let us create a conditional map of IMD scores based on the dominating gender and marital status of each area.\n",
